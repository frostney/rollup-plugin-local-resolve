Rollup by default doesn't handle resolving `./folder` to `./folder/index.js` internally. While there is the `rollup-plugin-node-resolve` plugin which also resolves directories as well as all dependencies from the `node_modules` directory, these may sometimes be too much for the use case at hand.

## Installation
```
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-local-resolve
```

## Usage
```javascript
import { rollup } from 'rollup';
import localResolve from 'rollup-plugin-local-resolve';

// This will resolve `./files` to `./files/index.js` if the file exists
rollup({
  entry: './files',
  plugins: [localResolve({
    extensions: ['.jsx', '.js'] // default ['.js']
  })],
});
```

## Things to improve on
- Check for `index.js` file asynchronously
- Use absolute paths instead of relative ones to be consistent with how Rollup handles modules
